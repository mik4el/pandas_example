# Pandas example
Here I'm testing Jupyter and Pandas for playing around with some data science and fun python.

## To start
1. Install requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. In this directory run `jupyter notebook`

## Todos
* Get data from Monday from Omni board
* Show some data from Monday in Jupyter notebook
* Make something useful

## Notes
`pokemon_data.csv` from https://github.com/KeithGalli/pandas and the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg
